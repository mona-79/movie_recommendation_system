## Introduction

Movie recommendation systems aim to suggest relevant movies to users based on their historical interactions, preferences, or characteristics of movies themselves. This project explores 
various techniques to build a movie recommendation system using Python.

## Installation

To run the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mona-79/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, you can use the recommendation system by running the appropriate scripts. Detailed instructions for running the system can be
found in the codebase.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used for this project includes two CSV files: `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`. These files contain information about movies, credits, genres, keywords, cast,
and crew. Data preprocessing steps include cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves extracting relevant features from the dataset to improve the recommendation system's performance. This includes processing genres, keywords, cast, and crew 
information to create meaningful tags for each movie.

## Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm used in this system is based on cosine similarity. After processing the features and creating tags for each movie, cosine similarity is computed between
movies based on their tags. The system then recommends movies similar to a given input movie.

## Results

The recommendation system provides accurate and relevant movie suggestions based on user input. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy can be used to assess the 
system's performance.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this movie recommendation system effectively suggests movies to users based on their preferences and interactions. Further enhancements and optimizations can be explored to
improve the system's accuracy and efficiency.
